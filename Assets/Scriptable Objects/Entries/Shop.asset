  entryText: Among the chaos of worlds colliding, a chain of Umbrella Corp. stores
    have sprung up anywhere there has been a worldly collision. They offer Boxes,
    which can be used to capture Monsters, as well as Fusers, which can be used to
    fuse monsters. Money can be obtained from trainers around the world.
