  entryTitle: Trainers
  entryText: There are four trainers scattered across the world to find. Each of
    them specializes in a specific type. Pay attention to what area the trainer is
    in to get an idea of what type they prefer to use. Each trainer will give $1000
    when defeated, which can be spent in the shop. Trainers can only be defeated
    once.
