  entryTitle: Fusion
  entryText: 'Fusion is a means of fusing two monsters together to get a stronger
    monster. The fused monster will share the types and moves of the two units used
    to fuse it. Fusing two of the same unit together will result in getting more
    powerful versions of the original monsters moves instead. In order to fuse monsters
    you must first buy a "fuser" from the shop for $500. Afterwards, click the DNA
    button, then the two monsters you want to fuse. Note: You cannot fuse fusions.'
