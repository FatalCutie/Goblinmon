  entryTitle: Story
  entryText: Fifteen years ago was the first collision. What was formerly known as
    New York city collided with a parallel world, mixing our world with a more alien
    one, turning New York into a treehouse jungle now known as Big Chimp City. Every
    few years more collisions occur, mashing biomes together with no rhyme or reason.
    With this fusion of biomes came monsters. Thanks to breakthroughs by Professor
    Jugan, we learned that these monsters could be fused with other monsters, creating
    stronger, more powerful monsters that humans have been living alongside and adapting
    to.
