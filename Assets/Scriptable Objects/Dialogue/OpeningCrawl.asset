  - Welcome to the world of Fusionmon!
  - I'm Professor Jugan, but everyone just calls me the GOAT, whatever that means!
  - We humans used to live peacefully in the world, until an event of cataclismic
    proportion fused our world with one we had never seen before!
  - With it brought monsters, which we came to live alongside as friends.
  - 'At times we play together, other times we work together. '
  - Some people even use their monsters to battle, and develop closer bonds with
    them.
  - What a surprise it was when we realized we could use these bonds to fuse our
    newfound friends with other monsters!
  - If you're moving here, I believe you'll need a monster of your own to get you
    started.
  - Pick your favorite! I should mention each monster does have a "level" assigned
    to them, but that doesn't actually indicate how strong they are.
  - This "level" is a good indication of how much damage a monster can take, but
    perhaps a monsters strength lies in their strength, not their bulk!
  - I'll get out of your way now. Welcome to Fusionmon!
