  - Wow, that was quite the battle!
  - Me? Oh, I'm not the player. I'm actually the creator of the game!
  - I'm sure you'll be thrilled to know the proper authorities showed up moments
    after you blacked out.
  - What now? Well, you can replay the game if you'd like, or maybe try the Oblivion
    remake. I heard it was pretty good.
  - Me? I'm off to start another game of course! It was a joy making Fusionmon but
    I'm ready for a new challenge.
  - I'm thinking of experimenting with a Turn Based RPG Roguelike. Will it suck?
    Maybe! But I'll learn a lot!
  - 'That''s all from me. Thank you so much for playing my game! '
